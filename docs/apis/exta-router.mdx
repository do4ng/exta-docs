`$exta-router` is the core router of exta, provided as a Vite virtual module.

```ts
import {
  useLocation,
  useParams,
  useRouter,
  router,
  usePathname,
  useSearchQuery,
} from "$exta-router";
```

The router provided by exta comes in two types: the URL Router and the Module Router. Since they serve completely different purposes, itâ€™s important to distinguish between them.

The URL Router is, as the name suggests, related to URL handling.
You can access the current location through a hook, and you can perform operations such as `push` and `replace`.
Functions based on this URL Router include `useLocation()`, `usePathname()`, `useSearchQuery()`, and `useParams()`.

In contrast, the Module Router can be considered the core router for managing modules.
With the Module Router, you can load page modules or fetch data from a specific page.

## URL Router

### `useLocation()` <Badge type="warning">React Only</Badge>

Returns the current location.
This hook can only be used inside React components.

```ts
const location = useLocation(); // href
const pathname = usePathname(); // pathname
const query = useSearchQuery(); // searchQuery
```

---

### `useParams()` <Badge type="warning">React Only</Badge>

Returns the parameters of a dynamic route.
It is built on top of `useLocation()`.

```ts
const params = useParams();
```

This hook can also be used inside special files such as `_layout`.

---

### `useRouter()` <Badge type="warning">React Only</Badge>

Provides router utilities for URL navigation.
It is also based on `useLocation()`.

```ts
const { location, push, replace } = useRouter();
```

## Module Router

<Box type="warning">
  The value returned by `useRouter()` is the URL Router, while `router` refers
  to the Module Router. They are completely different instances, so be careful
  not to confuse them.
</Box>

---

### `preload()`

Preloads a page module (page component file).
Pages that have already been loaded will not be reloaded.

```ts
router.preload(router.findPage("/"));
```

---

### `preloadAllPages()`

Loads all JavaScript page components.

---

### `findPage()`

Takes a specific URL and retrieves information about the corresponding page (including the component, source file, etc.).

---

### `prefetch()`

Fetches the server data for a specific page.

```ts
router.prefetch("/");
```

> The server data is the data generated by `getStaticProps()`.
