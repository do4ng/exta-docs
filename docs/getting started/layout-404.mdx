## Layout Component

The `_layout.{tsx|jsx}` file defines a shared layout for all pages.
It allows you to provide a consistent structure such as navigation bars, footers, or global styles.

> Only **one layout file** is allowed per application, and it must be placed in the top-level `/pages` directory.

```tsx
export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}
```

The core router automatically provides `children` as a prop, which represents the currently rendered page.

## Error Page

The `_error.{tsx|jsx}` file is used to implement a custom 404 error page.
This page is displayed when the requested route does not exist.

```tsx
export default function Error() {
  return <>Page Not Found</>;
}
```

You can customize this component to include links back to the home page, helpful messages, or any other UI for a better user experience.
