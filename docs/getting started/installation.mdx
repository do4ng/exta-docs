## Download template

The easiest way to get started with the exta app is to download a pre-made template.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/do4ng/exta-template my-app
```

After this prompt, go to the directory and type a command (like `npm install`) to install the dependencies.

## Manual installation

You can also install exta into an existing project.

Since exta is a vite-based framework, please install dependencies related to vite and react.

```bash
npm i --save-dev exta vite @vitejs/plugin-react
npm i --save-dev react react-dom
```

And create `vite.config.ts` and configure the configuration file as follows:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

import { exta } from "exta";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), exta()],
});
```

Then, add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite dev",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

Last, create `index.html` and add required scripts and container.

```html {3, 7}
<head>
  <!-- ... -->
  <script src="/.exta/client.js" type="module"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- ... -->
  %body%
</body>
```

## Setup Typescript

To make full use of the types provided by exta, create a `.d.ts` file like the following:

```ts
// env.d.ts
import "exta/env.d.ts";
```
