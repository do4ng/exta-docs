## Test Locally

Before deploying, make sure your app works correctly in the local environment.

1. Build your app:

```bash
vite build
```

2. Once the build is complete, preview the built app:

```bash
vite preview
```

## What you have to do

Each hosting provider has its own way of handling routing.  
Since exta generates static pages as `.html` files, some hosting services (especially those that don't support clean URLs) may not display pages correctly unless the proper routing configuration is set.

Checking this in advance ensures your app will run smoothly after deployment.

### Netlify

Netlify supports clean URLs by default, so no additional configuration is required.

### Vercel

Modify `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "cleanUrls": true
}
```
