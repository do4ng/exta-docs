Using the modules provided by **exta**, users can experience smoother navigation between pages.

Since exta is a static site generator primarily designed for documentation, blogs, and landing pages, smooth page transitions are considered a top priority.
When a user first visits the site, all page components are **prefetched for rendering**.
During navigation, only the corresponding **static props** are downloaded, ensuring fast and seamless page transitions.

## `<Link />`

The `<Link />` component enables client-side navigation without triggering a full page reload.

> When a `<Link />` is clicked, the static props for the target page are downloaded and cached.

```tsx
import { Link } from "exta/components";

export default function () {
  return <Link href="/">Go to Home</Link>;
}
```

<Box type="warning">Navigating to external URLs is not allowed.</Box>

## \$exta-router

`$exta-router` is the core router of exta, provided as a Vite virtual module.

```ts
import {
  useLocation,
  useParams,
  useRouter,
  router,
  usePathname,
  useSearchQuery,
} from "$exta-router";
```

### `useLocation()` <Badge type="warning">React Only</Badge>

Returns the current location.
This hook can only be used inside React components.

```ts
const location = useLocation(); // href
const pathname = usePathname(); // pathname
const query = useSearchQuery(); // searchQuery
```

---

### `useParams()` <Badge type="warning">React Only</Badge>

Returns the parameters of a dynamic route.
It is built on top of `useLocation()`.

```ts
const params = useParams();
```

This hook can also be used inside special files such as `_layout`.

---

### `useRouter()` <Badge type="warning">React Only</Badge>

Provides router utilities for URL navigation.
It is also based on `useLocation()`.

```ts
const { location, push, replace } = useRouter();
```

---

### `router`

A core router instance that manages modules and static props.

```ts
await router.goto("/");
// Instructs the router to download and cache static props for the "/" page.
// Navigating to external URLs is not allowed.
```

Unlike `useRouter`, calling `router.goto()` **does not navigate** to the page â€” it only downloads the associated data.
Therefore, when navigating programmatically without `<Link />`, you should combine both:

```ts
await router.goto(href); // prefetch static props
useRouter().push(href); // navigate to the page
```
