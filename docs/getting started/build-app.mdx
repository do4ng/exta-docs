exta generates static pages using its own compiler on top of Vite's build functionality.

```bash
vite build
```

Before building, be aware that there is a difference between the production app and the development server app.

## Server Side Rendering

By default, exta runs only with JavaScript in development mode, while in production mode it uses HTML (server-rendered) + JavaScript to implement pages. Because of this, there may be differences between the app in development mode and the app in production mode.

## \$exta-router

\$exta-router operates based on various browser-provided features. However, during the SSR process in the build, browser features are not available. To prevent potential issues, the server sends router information based on file names.

1. Dynamic routes are determined by file names and `getStaticParams()`.

2. Default routes are also determined based on file names.

3. `_layout` receives a URL based on the corresponding page.

4. Files like `_error`, which cannot be determined based on file names, are assigned `.exta/ssr:unknown`.

## Styles Asset

Asset files like `.css` handled by Vite cannot be loaded on the server. Therefore, these files are ignored by the server.

## Data Fetching

The way data is loaded also changes.

In development mode, data is fetched from a page in the form of `/.exta/__page_data?page={URL}`, but in production mode, it is loaded from pre-generated static data in the `/data/` directory.
