## Folders and Files Conventions

### Folders

Folders in the root directory are used to distinguish the purpose of files.
The most common one is the **`/pages/`** directory, which contains all route-related files.

| Directory   |                 |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| **/pages/** | Pages directory |

### Files

Certain file names are treated as **special routing files** and are not directly included as routes themselves.
They provide framework-level behavior such as layouts and error handling.

| Filename     | Extension      | Description              |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| **\_layout** | `.tsx`, `.jsx` | Layout component wrapper |
| **\_error**  | `.tsx`, `.jsx` | Error page (e.g., 404)   |

---

## Routes

The following examples show how file names are mapped to routes:

| Filename        | Extension      | Path     |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| `index`         | `.tsx`, `.jsx` | /        |
| `foo/index`     | `.tsx`, `.jsx` | /foo     |
| `foo/bar`       | `.tsx`, `.jsx` | /foo/bar |
| `foo/bar/index` | `.tsx`, `.jsx` | /foo/bar |

---

## Dynamic Routes

Dynamic segments are declared using square brackets `[ ]`.
This makes it possible to capture values from the URL.

| Filename             | Extension      | Path          |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| `path/[param]`       | `.tsx`, `.jsx` | /\:param      |
| `path/[param]/index` | `.tsx`, `.jsx` | /\:param      |
| `path/[param]/list`  | `.tsx`, `.jsx` | /\:param/list |

> Catch-all route segments like `[...]` are **not supported** for static route generation.
> This restriction ensures that all possible paths are explicitly defined at build time.
