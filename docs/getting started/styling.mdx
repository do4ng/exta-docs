Since exta is built on top of Vite, you can style your app by importing style files or registering them in the `index.html` file.

```ts
import "../styles.scss";
```

<Box type="warning">
  For files that require separate compilation, such as `scss`, you need to
  install an additional package (e.g., `node-sass`).
</Box>

## Stylesheets on the server

Files for styling (`.css`, `.scss`, etc.) cannot be loaded on the server. Therefore, exta excludes all files recognized as style files from the server.

```ts
// ...
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // ...
    exta({
      compileOptions: {
        assetsExtensions: [".customcss"],
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```
